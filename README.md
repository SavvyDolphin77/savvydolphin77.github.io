# Conner Harbaugh's Personal Portfolio Website

This is the complete source code for my [personal website](https://savvydolphin77.github.io).

Site includes various things such as my resume, how to contact me, my information, and what projects I have worked on.

## Status

Project is currently complete for the most part and live on the site above. The business section still has to be completed but more work in the background has to go on there. 

So, site is for the most part done besides continued support via minor bug fixes and suggestions. If you have any, please open an issue detailing the bug or suggestion.

~~Currently in progress. Template page format has been created, and colors scheme has been refined.~~

~~Now working on filling out content and adding features to each of the pages.~~
