          <p>
            Hello there. My name is Conner Harbaugh and I designed this website.
            As someone who is passionate about computers, programming is just
            one of the many ways to show off my skills. This passion for
            computers came about around 7th grade where I participated in my
            high school's cyber security club. There I gained knowledge on how
            to keep computers safe, use various software to set up secure
            applications like websites and databases, and even got to compete in
            some competitions. One of these competitions was the Air Force
            Association's CyberPatriot competition, which I did in middle school
            and high school, where my team and I made it in the top of our state
            multiple times. Another competition I competed in in high school was
            the Palmetto Cyber Defense Competition (PCDC) which is a competition
            that involves securing networks of machines designed to stimulate
            normal business applications from hackers attacking in real time. My
            team and I managed to win twice out of the three times we competed.
            Today I still participate in cyber competitions with my college such
             as various Capture the Flag competitions and the National Colliegate
             Cyber Defense competition.</p>
          <p>
            I am also an Eagle Scout, the highest rank in the Boy Scouts of
            America awarded for leadership and knowlege of the outdoors. To
            obtain this presitigious award I had to manage and led a community
            service project. The one that I did was to help refurbish all 170
            street posts of Sullivan's Island in South Carolina. There I and a
            team of volunteers that I got together worked to scrub down and
            repaint each of the posts. Taking two days it was diffently a good
            learning expirence not only for the leadership skills as I had to
            organize it but also nice to see how it helped out the community
            looking at how well the posts came out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another project I lead was my capstone for my senior year in
            High School. My capstone was essentially a project to run an
            organize a cyber security competition similar to that of the
            Palmetto Cyber Defense Competition and National Colliegate Cyber
            Defense Competition. I worked with my school's cyber security team
            and used business tools such as Microsoft Project to plan and organize
            the effots to create the competition setup. There I had to plan out
            and create a business like network by creating LAMP stacks, web
            applications, databases, file servers, and more to then add
            vulernabilities to them. It definitely helped grow my understanding
            of the technology and increase my interest in using these tools.
