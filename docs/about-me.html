            Hello there! My name is Conner Harbaugh.
          </h2>
          <p>
            As an Eagle Scout, I work towards creating and giving back to the commuunity. It is partially
            why I am also currently majoring in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">University of Central Florida</a> as
            I see computer science as a unique way to give back and help other people through innovative
            and accessible programs and software. The other reason that got me into computer science was my
            interest at a young age when I participated and competed with my high school's cyber security club.
          </p>
          <p>
            Competing and learing at my cybersecurity club in high school taught me a lot of valuable things. One
            is that it got me experience with using a lot of tools such as Linux, Amazon Web Services, web applications,
            and much much more. This exposure helped spark interest in the computer field. I have also gained great
            soft skills through competing in the competions as a team. Durning the competitions while under the threat
            of live hackers it can be immensely stressful and being able to work together is key. Having won two out of three
            times at the <a href="http://pcdc-sc.com/" target="_blank">Palmetto Cyber Defense Competition</a>, it seems that
            the teamwork we had paid off and those skills I gained with communication and teamwork will last a life time.
          </p>
          <p>
            These soft skills where further carried along when I worked on my capstone project for high school. There I
            created and ran a cyber security competiton amongst members of other schools to compete against each other.
            This used live enviroments where I had to lead and build out various machines to stimulate a business like network
            using VMware ESXI to spin up machines such as web applications via LAMP stack, ftp servers, remote desktop and
            AD servers. The whole capstone process involved using new technologies I have used for such as Microsoft Project to help keep track
            of the progress. It again involved soft skills where I have to communicate to the people that I was working with
            so that we could stay on pace and accomplish our goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            This exprience and skills have landed me my current job as a webdeveloper and techranger for the University of Central Florida's
            Center for Distrubuted Learning. There I apply my knowledge and skill set to develop and help maintain the university's online
            learning projects which are used by more than thousands of students each day. This has begun to help teach me industry level pratices as
            well as improving my skills in software development which I can then carry and apply to in real life and other jobs.
          </p>
          <h2>More Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            When not focusing on computer science, I enjoy a great deal of hobbies. For example I enjoy a good game of chess, and really any strategy
            game for that matter such as Risk or Stellaris. These games get me thinking and analyzing the situation so that learn better of how to plan
            and think ahead. I apply this to real life as well as like the Boy Scout motto says, be perpared, I am always thinking three steps ahead when it
            comes to developing software or securing computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy the great outdoors. From hiking up mountains to exploring dark cramp caves, it provides both a sense of adventure, a breath of freash
            air, and a great source of inspiration. I find inspiration not only from the beauty of nature but also from good books. Some of which include,
            the novel <i>Great Expectations</i> by Charles Dickens. This book was a great novel to read and really drove a message about having great expectations.
            It filled me with hope and a desire to follow through my own great expectations to help provide for the community and help others.

          <input type="checkbox" id="nicknameQuestion" />
          <label onclick="faqOpenClose(labelNicknameQuestion)" id="labelNicknameQuestion" class="accordionTitle" tabindex="0" for="nicknameQuestion">Where did the pseudonym for your Github account, Savvy Dolphin, come from?</label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              The structure of the name came from one of my all time games as kid, Poptropica. A great game while it lasted but it resonated with me through
              telling neat and deep family friendly stories on some of its islands which has since provided me inspiration for my game development projects
              as well as other factors in life.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for the name it self, sort of involves two parts. First is the savvy part and this comes from a personal reflection of myself. In that I
              tend to find myself as a savvy guy, plus its a savvy word after all and sounds nice. The other part, dolphin comes my interest and liking of
              dolphins as creatures. Probably my favorite animal, dolphins are some of the more intelligent species on the planet. They are also to be known
              for a sense of humor so this intelligent and humor attributes I found similar to myself.

          <label onclick="faqOpenClose(labelMotivateQuestion)" id="labelMotivateQuestion" class="accordionTitle" tabindex="0" for="motivateQuestion">What motivates you?</label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              There a lot of things that can motivate someone but for me personally its the desire to do good and give back to the community. Its to make
              life have a purpose in a sense and what greater purpose is that then helping others?
            </p>
            <p>
              My family and friends also provide support and have keep encouraging me to stay determined to push through tough assignments and projects.
            </p>

          <label tabindex="0" onclick="faqOpenClose(labelAspireQuestion)" id="labelAspireQuestion" class="accordionTitle" for="aspireQuestion">What do you aspire for?</label>

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              That is a hard question to answer as goals shift form time to time, but I think my biggest desire and apsiration currently would be like mentioned
              before to help and give back to my community. Specifically in software development and is why I lauched and pioneered my business which you can
              read more about in <a href="business-ventures.html">business ventures</a> page. The real goal is to create products in non intrusive ways that still
              manage to be the same level of efficiency and cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also generally aspire to be just be a good person. While no one is perfect as an Eagle scout I hold my self to certain moral standards deriving from the
              Scout's Law, such as being trustworthy, loyal, helpful, courteous, and kind. In part I do that by giving back to community through the work and projects
              I do, but I also carry this philisophy out in every day life to continue striving and improving myself to be the best person I can be.
