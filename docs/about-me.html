          <p>
            Hello there. My name is Conner Harbaugh and I designed this website.
            As someone who is passionate about computers, programming is just
            one of the many ways to show off my skills. This passion for
            computers came about around 7th grade where I participated in my
            high school's cyber security club. There I gained knowledge on how
            to keep computers safe, use various software to set up secure
            applications like websites and databases, and even got to compete in
            some competitions. One of these competitions was the Air Force
            Association's CyberPatriot competition, which I did in middle school
            and high school, where my team and I made it in the top of our state
            multiple times. Another competition I competed in in high school was
            the Palmetto Cyber Defense Competition (PCDC) which is a competition
            that involves securing networks of machines designed to stimulate
            normal business applications from hackers attacking in real time. My
            team and I managed to win twice out of the three times we competed.
            Today I still participate in cyber competitions with my college such
             as various Capture the Flag competitions and the National Colliegate
             Cyber Defense competition.</p>
          <p>
            I am also an Eagle Scout, the highest rank in the Boy Scouts of
            America awarded for leadership and knowlege of the outdoors. To
            obtain this presitigious award I had to manage and led a community
            service project. The one that I did was to help refurbish all 170
            street posts of Sullivan's Island in South Carolina. There I and a
            team of volunteers that I got together worked to scrub down and
            repaint each of the posts. Taking two days it was diffently a good
            learning expirence not only for the leadership skills as I had to
            organize it but also nice to see how it helped out the community
            looking at how well the posts came out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another project I lead was my capstone for my senior year in
            High School. My capstone was essentially a project to run an
            organize a cyber security competition similar to that of the
            Palmetto Cyber Defense Competition and National Colliegate Cyber
            Defense Competition. I worked with my school's cyber security team
            and used business tools such as Microsoft Project to plan and organize
            the effots to create the competition setup. There I had to plan out
            and create a business like network by creating LAMP stacks, web
            applications, databases, file servers, and more to then add
            vulernabilities to them. It definitely helped grow my understanding
            of the technology and increase my interest in using these tools.

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

          <input type="checkbox" id="FQABox1" />
          <label for="FQABox1">Where did the name Savvy Dolphin 77 from Github come from?</label>

          <div class="FQAcontent">
            <p>
              The name came about from my liking of dolphins. Always enjoyed
              seeing them as well as how intellectual they appear to be. Sort of
              where savvy part came in as well as I always figured dolphins
              where savvy due to their intelligence and playful behavior, and
              saw this in myself as well. I also consider to be savvy in
              computers so why I chose that adjective. The number 77 came from
              lucky number 7, but I think that two sevens are greater then one.
              Plus, seventy seven has a nicer ring to it then just seven in my
              personal opinion.

          <label for="FQABox2">What inspires you?</label>

          <div class="FQAcontent">
            <p>
              I think what inspires me to program and develop/create stuff is the
              idea of making the world a better place. It is nice to make stuff that
              hopefully other people will enjoy and use for a long time, and
              really just puts a smile on my face. I want to leave the world a
              better place so why I do the stuff I do. I think that being an
              Eagle Scout has also helped shaped this philsophopy. This is a
              major part why I am into cyber security as it helps protects other
              people which I find rewarding. The idea of of just giving back to
              the community is that inspiration. <br><br>I am also inspired a lot by
              nature and just its raw beauty. For example clouds durning a
              rainstorm or a sunset just leave me feeling better and inspired
              to try in my limited human why to create something as amazing as that.

          <input type="checkbox" id="FQABox3" />
          <label for="FQABox3">What are your goals and are trying to accomplish?</label>

          <div class="FQAcontent">
            <p>
              Sort of like I mentioned in the inspiring question, I want to give
              back to my community and so my goals are to do things to help
              other people or things that others can enjoy. It is partially why
              I work on my businesses as a means to fufill those goals. InLense
              is the technology company meant to better communities through
              education as well as new technologies to make life easier, while
              as the Savvy Dolphin Entertainment Studios is more for making
              things for people to enjoy through video games. <br><br>On a more
              personal note, some goals or bucket wishes is that I would like to
              travel to space and around the world.
